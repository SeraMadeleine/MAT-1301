MAT-1301 Innf√∏ring i kryptografi, UiT

## Assignment 1 
The assignment was to create a program capable of decrypting Vigenere ciphers.
If you use this application on documents written in a language other than English, it will probably produce incorrect results.

The cipher text and a maximum length for the key are all that are required to start the program. This are all pre-defind in the config.py file.
